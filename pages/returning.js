      <Calculator status={'returning'}>
        <p>In April of 2022, you were asked to complete an intent to return form with the anticipation of a proposed incentive to be paid in or around October 2022.</p>
        <p>The proposal was approved and the incentive will be paid out over the coming months.</p>
        <p>Please note that this calculator is designed to give you an estimate of the dollar amount of your incentive and will not take any special circumstances into account.</p>
        <p>Additionally, these calculations only reflect retention incentive amounts for returning employees. Newly negotiated rates in TCTA and AFT agreements are not reflected in this total.</p>
